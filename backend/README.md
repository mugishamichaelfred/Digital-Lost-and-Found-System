# 🔍 Digital Lost and Found System – Backend

This is the backend for the **Digital Lost and Found System**, a secure, web-based platform developed as a final year project to help users report, search for, and verify lost, found, and stolen items. It is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, and documented with **Swagger/OpenAPI** for easy frontend integration.

## 📘 Project Overview

In today’s digital age, losing personal belongings such as smartphones, ID cards, and documents is a persistent issue. Traditional recovery methods—like social media or bulletin boards—are often unorganized and inefficient. This system addresses that gap by offering a structured and secure platform to manage lost and found items.

The system development followed Agile methodology, progressing through phases of requirement gathering, design, development, and testing. It integrates secure data handling, intuitive UI design (handled by the frontend), and robust backend APIs.

## 🎯 Objectives

### General Objective
Develop a scalable, digital platform that improves the efficiency of recovering lost, found, or stolen items.

### Specific Objectives
- Design a user-friendly system to report and track lost/found items.
- Implement a secure database architecture for storing and retrieving item and user data.
- Deploy a web-accessible service to facilitate recovery and prevent fraudulent claims.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Current lost and found systems are fragmented and lack verification processes, leading to inefficiencies and increased chances of items remaining unclaimed or exploited through fraud. This system seeks to solve these issues through a centralized, secure digital solution.
